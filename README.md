# EC_Xray
Python package for analyzing data from and assisting the development of electrochemistry with in-situ synchrotron techniques.

This python package was developed while doing in-situ CO reduction experiments at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Light Source (SSRL) beamlines 2-1 and 11-2. 
The scripts here read data as it is output by SSRL's SPEC program (Xray data) and Biologic's EC-Lab (EC data).
Feel free to make a fork and/or contact the developer for colaboration if you're interested in extension of the tools to other data types or platforms.

Many functions in the object-oriented code here are informed by previous scripts by e.g. SSRL scientist Kevin Stone and Stanford PhD student Brenna Gibbons. 
The synchronization and plotting methods draw on scott's experience with electrochemistry-mass spectrometry data (see <a href="https://github.com/ScottSoren/EC_MS">EC_MS</a>).

Please contact the developer with any questions or suggestions.
Enjoy!

p.s. if you use this for work that gets published, you don't have to cite it, but awesome if you'd like to! Let me know and I'll figure out how.

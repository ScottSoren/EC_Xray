===============================================
``EC_Xray`` - Electrochemistry with X-ray package
===============================================
Python package for analyzing data from and assisting the development of electrochemistry with in-situ synchrotron techniques.

The functionality of the package will, if there is interest, be reproduced in The In-situ Experimental Data Tool, ``ixdat``.

This python package was developed while doing in-situ CO reduction experiments at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Light Source (SSRL) beamlines 2-1 and 11-2. 
The scripts here read data as it is output by SSRL's SPEC program (Xray data) and Biologic's EC-Lab (EC data).

Many functions in the object-oriented code here are informed by previous scripts by e.g. SSRL scientist Kevin Stone and Stanford PhD student Brenna Gibbons. 
The synchronization and plotting methods draw on scott's experience with electrochemistry-mass spectrometry data (see `EC_MS <https://github.com/ScottSoren/EC_MS>`_).

Tutorials and citation
==========================
In lieu of documentation, there are `extensive ipython tutorials available here <https://github.com/ScottSoren/Tutorials/tree/master/EC_Xray_tutorials>`_

This package was used for and introduced in:

Soren B. Scott,et al. Absence of Oxidized Phases in Cu under CO Reduction Conditions. `ACS Energy Lett, 2019 <http://doi.org/10.1021/acsenergylett.9b00172>`_.

Please cite it if you find ``EC_Xray`` useful.

Project Information
===================
``EC_Xray`` is completely free and open source.

Please contact the developer with any questions or suggestions, and consider contributing to ``ixdat``.

Enjoy!
